# ðŸŒ³ Go Bonzaiâ„¢ Default `help` Command

This is the default help originally included with the [Go Bonzai
package](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) itself but factored out so
that it's `Version` tag could be consistent with other Bonzai branches
(which correspond to git tags by convention). This also allows other
(potentially better) `help.Cmd` to be developed without a substantial
bias one way or another.

## Install

```go
package z

import (
	Z "github.com/rwxrob/bonzai/z"
	"github.com/rwxrob/help"
)

var Cmd = &Z.Cmd{
	Name:     `z`,
	Commands: []*Z.Cmd{help.Cmd}, // usually first
}
```
